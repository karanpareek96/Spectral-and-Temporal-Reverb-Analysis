# Abstract

This study presents the digital implementation of five widely used reverberation modules in MATLAB. By employing concepts of digital filters and convolution, the models are intended to simulate a live acoustic space. A detailed spectral and temporal analysis is undertaken using graphical representation to gain an understanding of the modules’ influence on the time and frequency domain. Towards the end, the results of the study have been examined using acoustical analysis tools.

# Introduction

Digitally generated reverberation algorithms have been widely adopted since the early 1960s. Its construction has been reviewed and revised over the years, allowing them to function efficiently in real-time. From Schroeder’s study on natural sounding reverberation techniques to the Freeverb module implemented in C++, algorithms for sound reverberation have not only become faster but also allow users to incorporate properties of equalization and other FX processing as part of the output chain. The concept of reverberation encompasses various concepts of acoustics including reflections and resonance. Thus, an understanding of reverbs enables musicians and engineers to examine acoustic spaces in greater detail. Concepts such as RT60, energy dissipation and frequency distribution derived from a reverberated signal allow a user to model and modify acoustic spaces more efficiently. The focus of this study will be to provide an overview of five widely implemented reverberation modules and analyze their spectral influence on a signal using temporal and spectral analysis tools.
